## Migration strategy

Migration will occur on a capability-by-capability basis, e.g., "Change password" is the first capability to be migrated from the legacy implementation to the new one.

This is being done through the use of a Proxy, concretely speaking, [Caddy](https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy) in our stack.

Migrating legacy routes will be accomplished through rules established in the Proxy, i.e., the `/docker/next-app/Caddyfile`.

**Change password data flow example:**

1. request for the legacy route, `/app/changepassword`, comes into the Proxy and the following rules are encountered:

> ```
> @next_app_paths {
> 	path /_app/*
> 	path /app/changepassword
> 	path /password*
> }
> route @next_app_paths {
> 	rewrite /app/changepassword /password/change
> 	reverse_proxy {$NEXT_APP}
> }
>
> reverse_proxy {$LEGACY_APP}
> ```

2. `/app/changepassword` will match `@next_app_paths` and the request will be rewritten **internally** to `/password/change` and sent to the Next App for handling.

> Rewriting this internally does two things, it leaves the user's original URL intact and it also allows the Next App to maintain a sensible and flexible routing structure in isolation, i.e., none of the legacy choices in routes need to pollute the design in the Next App.

3. This incoming route will be handled by the Next App and the response will be returned back through the Proxy and eventually to the end user.

> Handling requests through the proxy in this way allows us to avoid CORS handling in the Legacy App's PHP backend as well as avoiding additional certificate management.

## Technology stack for Next App

- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) – Language abstraction for UI that compiles to small, performant, vanilla JavaScript
- [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) – Pre-designed UI componentry
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) – CSS utils for class slinging in the (Svelte) UI (as well as the foundation for daisyUI)
- [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) – Javascript backend supporting SSG, SSR, and client-side hydration

## Technical design notes

### Project structure

```
src
├── lib (shared functionality)
├── routes (views and backend call handlers)
```

#### `lib`

> Code under `lib` is being organized by shared functionality, e.g., `error` holds a UI component, `Error.svelte` as well as an `index.js` since error handling involves both UI and a shared API for the rest of the app. Using `index.js` gives consumers a little syntactic sugar to import `$lib/error`, e.g., `import { throwError } '$lib/error'`. As a matter of practice, code can begin stand-alone in the root of this folder until there's a need to organize things under a more cohesive folder. This practice should help keep the root tidy.

#### `routes`

> Code under `routes` represents the views as well as any backend calls, refer to https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/routing for further details.

### UI design

#### Tailwindcss

Of course choosing tailwindcss comes with a number of criticisms but we believe it's a good choice for the following reasons:

1. The codebase can be kept free of class clutter by simply utlizing `@apply` in the `<style>` section of our `.svelte` files but when doing this a couple of things need to be taken into consideration:

> modifiers are not supported in `@apply` without additional `preprocess` and `postcss` configuration and increased specificity can sometimes cause problems when class overrides are needed on an element directly. See [Warn: Unused CSS selector](https://github.com/saadeghi/daisyui/discussions/1490) for some elaboration. We do still use the `@apply` in a component but not scoped, simply for an organizational benefit, see `/next-app/src/lib/forms/Form.svelte`

2. We will inevitably have situations where parent components or views will want to pass styles down to children. This is very common and requires writing global classes anyway. Using something like tailwindcss or bootstrap takes all of that work off of our plate. Unused CSS will still get purged by the compiler so the app doesn't take on unnecessary bloat.
3. daisyUI is built upon tailwindcss anyway so we benefit from using it in both situations.

#### daisyUI

With such a small team, we were always going to need a well thought-out UI library to keep us from having to make a bunch of design decisions along the way. While there are a handful of Svelte-based libraries, none of them met the criteria necessary to help make our team as efficient as possible. There were many mature UI systems already in place built upon tailwindcss and daisyUI represents one of the best of the ones we looked at in it's goal of further simplifying the use of tailwindcss. Additionally, daisyUI has already integrated many best practices and opinions in its design decisions.

### Backend layer

A backend layer is being utilized to insulate the UI from implemenation details in the calls to the legacy app's backend. In addition to this insulation, introducing this additional backend layer will allow the contracts between the UI and the backend to be more refined and sensible. There is a possibility that calls to the legacy app could move to a different provider at some point and this step now will facilitate that. It also shields the end user and UI from what are potenitally messy communication requirements with the legacy backend.

> As a result, the UI should only communicate with endpoints in the Next App. Page endpoints should be favored for Svelte views that require data be loaded for the page and stand-alone endpoints used for everything else, refer to https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/routing#endpoints for further details.

### Common error handling

In an effort to provide a common error experience for users and eliminate much of the boilerplate on devs, a central error handling implementation is provided in `$lib/error`. It has both a shared API as well as a component for use in the app. Central, generic hooks for client-side errors of all kinds have been implemented in the `$lib/error/index.js` but there are not similar hooks for _all_ error scenarios on the server-side which may result in more boilerplate for devs when it comes to error handling there.

### Common fetch

In an effort to reduce boilerplate, a common fetch was written. Since there are deviations between the way that is helpful on the client and server sides, they have been split into a client-side version and a server-side version instead of writing a bunch of `if`'s in a single file.

#### Client-side

Found in `$lib/fetch/client.js`. This wrapper exports some of the most common types of fetches, handles errors consistently and hooks into the client-side progress infrastructure.

#### Server-side

Found in `$lib/fetch/server.js`. This wrapper exports some of the most common types of fetches, handles errors consistently and abides by the legacy app's `/api/sf` contract.

### FAQ's

#### Why are we using `$$props.class` when Svelte docs suggest against it?

This a very well-known and conventional way of getting all you need from the element without the extra boilerplate code required to expose an explicit API for each [Attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/attributes) or "properties" as referred to by Svelte (https://svelte.dev/docs#template-syntax-attributes-and-props). See https://github.com/sillsdev/web-languageforge/pull/1416/files#r894114808 for further rationale and comparison of alternative which is considered unnecessarily verbose and not as maintainable.
